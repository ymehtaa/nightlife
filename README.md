# nightlife

Nightlife is an app that brings people together to build friendships, strengthen connections, and meet new people, all while staying financially responsible. Going out can be expensive, and without a surefire plan for the evening, costs can pile up. Nightlife works to help users plan refreshing nights out with friends, tailored to your personal preference while staying under your user-inputted budget. 

I conceptualized this core idea as well as the app's features and implemented an MVP in 6 weeks as a part of my senior project. I learnt many new skills including user research, software design, Firebase, and Android app development. 

The app is constructed through Android Studio, using Java and Firebase to hold it together.
